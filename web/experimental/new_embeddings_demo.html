            <div class="disclaimer">
                This codelab is being used to test out some new features of DartPad! You may encounter bugs,
                malapropisms, annoyances, and other general weirdness. If that happens, please take a moment to
                <a target="_BLANK" href="https://github.com/dart-lang/dart-pad/issues/new">fill out a bug report on
                    GitHub</a>
                and let us know. Feature requests and suggestions are also greatly appreciated.
            </div>
            <div class="disclaimer">
                You may notice some flutter_web tech being used in this codelab. It's a pre-release
                version that we're messing around with, so if you see something wonky or wonder why
                Feature X isn't working, don't assume that it'll look that way when Flutter Web is
                eventually released.
            </div>
            <div class="disclaimer">
                Also, this codelab is currently being developed and tested with Chrome. There may be
                (in the short term) features that work in some browsers and not others. If you encounter
                any, please feel free to file bugs using the link above.

            <p>
                <span class="code">Row</span> and <span class="code">Column</span> are two very important widgets in the
                Flutter universe. Want to put a <span class="code">Text</span> widget with a label next to another <span
                    class="code">Text</span> widget with the corresponding value? Use a <span class="code">Row</span>.
                Want to present multiple pairs of labels and values? That's a <span class="code">Column</span> full of
                <span class="code">Rows</span>. Forms with several fields, icons next to menu choices, buttons next to
                search bars, these are all places where <span class="code">Rows</span> and <span
                    class="code">Columns</span> get used,
            </p>
            <p>
                This codelab will walk you through how <span class="code">Rows</span> and <span
                    class="code">Columns</span> work. Because they're so similar, once you're done learning about <span
                    class="code">Rows</span>, the codelab mostly just shows you how all the same stuff applies to <span
                    class="code">Columns</span>. There are inline editors along the way so you can play around and test
                your knowledge.
            </p>

            <h3>Let's start with a Row and some children</h3>
            <p>
                The whole point of a <span class="code">Row</span> or <span class="code">Column</span> is to contain
                other widgets, known as children. In a <span class="code">Row</span>, children
                are arranged horizontally from first to last in accordance with text direction. If your device is set to
                English or another left-to-right language, they'll start from the left. If you're using Arabic or
                another right-to-left language, they'll start on the right and head left.
            </p>

            <h4>Code example</h4>
            <p>
                Below is a widget called <span class="code">MyWidget</span> that builds a single Row. Try adding three
                <span class="code">BlueBox</span> widgets to its list
                of children.
            </p>
            <iframe src="embed-new.html?id=76e993732820ef908ea8424744b9996d&fw=true"></iframe>

            <h3>Main axis size</h3>
            <p>
                The main axis of a <span class="code">Row</span> is the horizontal one (for <span
                    class="code">Columns</span>, it's the vertical axis). Each <span class="code">Row</span> has a
                property called <span class="code">mainAxisSize</span> that determines how much space it should take
                along that axis. By default,
                <span class="code">mainAxisSize</span> is set to <span class="code">MainAxisSize.max</span>, which
                causes a Row to take up all the available horizontal
                space. You can use <span class="code">MainAxisSize.min</span> to direct a <span class="code">Row</span>
                widget to take up as little space as possible.
            </p>

            <h4>Code example</h4>
            <p>
                Here's the example you just finished. Try setting the <span class="code">Row</span>'s <span
                    class="code">mainAxisSize</span> property to <span class="code">MainAxisSize.min</span>
                and see what happens.
            </p>
            <iframe src="embed-new.html?id=9ac4ade5961150a27d3e547b667c8037&fw=true"></iframe>

            <h3>Main axis alignment</h3>
            <p>
                If you've set the <span class="code">mainAxisSize</span> of a <span class="code">Row</span> to the
                minimum, there won't be any extra room beyond what the
                children use. If you've got it set to <span class="code">max</span>, though, the <span
                    class="code">Row</span> may have some additional space lying around.
                You can use the <span class="code">mainAxisAlignment</span> property to control how the <span
                    class="code">Row</span> aligns its children within that space.
            </p>
            <p>
                There are six different values available in the <span class="code">MainAxisAlignment</span> enum:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><span class="code">MainAxisAligment.start</span>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Place all children as close to the start of the <span class="code">Row</span> as possible
                            (for left-to-right rows, this is the left side)
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><span class="code">MainAxisAligment.end</span>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Place all children as close to the end of the <span class="code">Row</span> as possible</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><span class="code">MainAxisAligment.center</span>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Group the children together in the center of the <span class="code">Row</span></li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><span class="code">MainAxisAligment.spaceBetween</span>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Any extra space is divided evenly and used to make gaps between the children.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><span class="code">MainAxisAligment.spaceEvenly</span>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Just like <span class="code">spaceBetween</span>, except the spots before the first child
                            and after the last one also
                            count as gaps
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><span class="code">MainAxisAligment.spaceAround</span>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Just like <span class="code">spaceEvenly</span>, only the first and last gaps get 50% of the
                            amount used between
                            children.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Code example</h4>
            <p>
                The row below has its <span class="code">mainAxisAlignment</span> set to start. Try changing it to the
                other values and re-running
                the code to see how things move around.
            </p>

            <h3>Cross axis alignment</h3>
            <p>
                The cross axis for <span class="code">Row</span> widgets is the vertical axis, and you can use the <span
                    class="code">crossAxisAlignment</span> property to control how children are positioned vertically.
                The default value is <span class="code">CrossAxisAlignment.center</span>,
                but there are five options in total:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><span class="code">CrossAxisAlignment.start</span>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Children are aligned at the start of the <span class="code">Row</span>'s vertical space (by
                            default, the top is considered to be the start, though you can change that via the
                            <span class="code">verticalDirection</span> property)
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><span class="code">CrossAxisAlignment.end</span>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Children are aligned at the end of the <span class="code">Row</span>'s vertical space (by
                            default,
                            that means the bottom)
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><span class="code">CrossAxisAlignment.center</span>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Children are centered with respect to the vertical axis</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><span class="code">CrossAxisAlignment.stretch</span>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Children are forced to have the same height as the <span class="code">Row</span> itself,
                            filling
                            all the vertical space
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><span class="code">CrossAxisAlignment.baseline</span>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Children are aligned by their baselines (more on this one in a
                            second)
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Code example</h4>
            <p>
                This <span class="code">Row</span> has two small children and one big one. Its <span class="code">crossAxisAlignment</span>
                property is set to center, the default. Try changing it to the other values and re-running the code to
                see how things move around.
            </p>
            <p>
                A word of warning: <span class="code">CrossAxisAlignment.baseline</span> requires that another property
                be set as well, so you
                will see an error if you try that one. Don't worry, though -- it's covered in the next section.
            </p>
            <iframe src="embed-new.html?id=610aa31bbd09c90b5cede790bb6c3854&fw=true"></iframe>

            <h3>Baseline alignment</h3>
            <p>
                Sometimes it's handy to align widgets containing text not by their overall bounds, but by the baselines
                used by their characters. That's what <span class="code">CrossAxisAlignment.baseline</span> is for. You
                can use it in combination with a <span class="code">Row</span>'s <span class="code">textBaseline</span>
                property (which indicates which baseline to use) to align a <span class="code">Row</span>'s children
                along their baselines.
            </p>
            <p>
                Note that if set a <span class="code">Row</span>'s <span class="code">crossAxisAlignment</span> property
                to baseline without setting <span class="code">textBaseline</span> at the same
                time, your widgets will fail to build.
            </p>

            <h4>Code example</h4>
            <p>
                This row contains three <span class="code">Text</span> widgets with different font sizes. Try changing
                the <span class="code">crossAxisAlignment</span>
                property to <span class="code">baseline</span>, and experiment with different values for <span
                    class="code">textBaseline</span> as well (there's an enum called
                <span class="code">TextBaseline</span> that contains the valid baseline values).
            </p>
            <iframe src="embed-new.html?id=8c4a0571b161755c8d9235df947d268e&fw=true"></iframe>

            <h3>Flexible children</h3>
            <p>
                So far, all the widgets used as children in examples have had a fixed size. It's possible, though, for a
                <span class="code">Row</span> to have children that flex, and adapt to the available space. In order to
                understand how this works,
                it's best to take a look at how Rows size themselves and their children:
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>First, the <span class="code">Row</span> asks all of its children with fixed sizes how big they'd
                    like to be.
                </li>
                <li>Next, it calculates the remaining space in its main axis (horizontal).</li>
                <li>Then it divides up that remaining space among its flexible children according to their flex factors.
                    The flexible children can use some or all of the space they're offered.
                </li>
                <li>At that point, the <span class="code">Row</span> knows how big all of its children are, and can
                    align them using the same axis
                    size and alignment properties you've seen so far.
                </li>
            </ol>
            <p>
                Most widgets are considered to be of a fixed size. You can change that by wrapping them in a <span
                    class="code">Flexible</span>
                widget. <span class="code">Flexibles</span> have two important properties: a <span
                    class="code">flex</span> factor that determines how much of the remaining
                space they get in comparison to other <span class="code">Flexibles</span>, and a <span
                    class="code">fit</span> property that determines whether their child
                is forced to take up all the extra space it's offered.
            </p>

            <h4>Code example</h4>
            <p>
                Try wrapping the middle box in this row with a <span class="code">Flexible</span> widget that has a
                <span class="code">flex</span> factor of 1 and its <span class="code">fit</span>
                property set to <span class="code">FlexFit.loose</span>. Afterward, try changing the fit to tight and
                see what happens.
            </p>
            <p>
                This combination (a <span class="code">flex</span> factor of 1 and a tight <span class="code">fit</span>)
                is so popular, there's a whole widget just to make
                using them easier: <span class="code">Expanded</span>.
            </p>

            <h3>Flex factors</h3>
            <p>
                If more than one child of a <span class="code">Row</span> or <span class="code">Column</span> has a
                flexible size, the available space is allotted to them
                according to their <span class="code">flex</span> factors:
            </p>
            <div class="snippet">
                remainingSpace * (flex / totalOfAllFlexValues)
            </div>

            <h4>Code example</h4>
            <p>
                In this example, all three of the <span class="code">Row</span>'s children are <span class="code">Flexible</span>.
                Try changing their <span class="code">flex</span> values and
                re-running the code to see how the widgets' sizes adjust.
            </p>
            <iframe src="embed-new.html?id=4ab5409b566272c8f2cd28feddb0a995&fw=true"></iframe>

            <h3>What happens if you run out of space?</h3>
            <p>
                As you just saw, when a <span class="code">Row</span> asks one of its <span class="code">Flexible</span>
                children how big it wants to be, it gives the child
                a max width based on its <span class="code">flex</span> factor. However, fixed-size children get no such
                restriction. This is so
                they can determine their own intrinsic size.
            </p>
            <p>
                One side effect is that there's nothing stopping a fixed-size child from declaring itself to be bigger
                than the <span class="code">Row</span> can support. When that happens, a flex overflow results. You can
                fix it by changing the
                child widget so that it chooses a smaller size, or by using a scrolling widget.
            </p>

            <h4>Code example</h4>
            <p>
                The <span class="code">Row</span> below contains a single widget that's way too wide to fit. Run the
                code as-is to see what
                happens, then try modifying the width of the <span class="code">Container</span> to make it fit.
            </p>

            <h3>Try using SizedBox to make space</h3>
            <p>
                If you need a specific amount of space between two children of a <span class="code">Row</span>, an easy
                way to do it is by
                sticking a <span class="code">SizedBox</span> of the appropriate width in between.
            </p>

            <h4>Code example</h4>
            <p>
                Trying making some space between these two list items by placing a <span class="code">SizedBox</span>
                with a <span class="code">width</span> of 100 between them.
            </p>

            <h3>Spacers expand to make space</h3>
            <p>
                <span class="code">Spacers</span> are another convenient way to make space between items in a Row.
                They're flexible, and will
                expand to fill any leftover space.
            </p>

            <h4>Code example</h4>
            <p>
                Try adding a <span class="code">Spacer</span> in between the first and second children of the <span
                    class="code">Row</span> below.
            </p>

            <h3>Wait, wasn't I going to learn about Columns, too?</h3>
            <p>
                Surprise, you already have! <span class="code">Rows</span> and <span class="code">Columns</span> do the
                same job, just in different dimensions. The main
                axis of a <span class="code">Row</span> is horizontal, and the main axis of a <span
                    class="code">Column</span> is vertical, but they both size and position their
                children in the same way. They even share a base class, <span class="code">Flex</span>, so everything
                you've learned about <span class="code">Rows</span>
                applies to <span class="code">Columns</span> as well!
            </p>

            <h4>Code example</h4>
            <p>
                Here's a <span class="code">Column</span> with some children of various sizes and its most important
                properties set. Try fiddling
                around with them and you'll see that the <span class="code">Column</span> works like a vertical <span
                    class="code">Row</span>.
            </p>
            <iframe src="embed-new.html?id=6cafe7beab954e72fed2fd2393a29f6c&fw=true"></iframe>

            <h3>Putting it all together</h3>
            <p>
                Now that you're versed in <span class="code">Rows</span>, <span class="code">Columns</span>, and the
                important properties of both, you're ready to practice
                putting them together to build interfaces. The next few examples will guide you through the construction
                of a business card display.
            </p>

            <h4>Code example</h4>
            <p>
                Every business card needs a name and a title, so start with that.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Add a <span class="code">Column</span> widget</li>
                <li>Add two text widgets to the <span class="code">Column</span>'s list of children:</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>The first should be a name (a short one will be easier to fit into the small window) and use the
                        <span class="code">headline</span> style:
                    </li>
                    <ul>
                        <li><span class="code">style: Theme.of(context).textTheme.headline</span></li>
                    </ul>
                    <li>
                        The second should say 'Experienced App Developer' and use the default style (just leave the
                        <span class="code">style</span> property out entirely)
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <li>
                    Set the <span class="code">Column</span>'s <span class="code">crossAxisAlignment</span> to start, so
                    that the text widgets will be start-aligned rather
                    than centered.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Set the <span class="code">Column</span>'s <span class="code">mainAxisSize</span> to
                    <span class="code">MainAxisSize.min</span>, so the card won't expand to the full height of the
                    window.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <iframe class="tall" src="embed-new.html?id=5e7e9352bca878f446d4347f324e2f63&fw=true"></iframe>

            <p>
                Business cards often have an icon or logo in the top-left corner, so the next step is to add one to
                yours. Start by wrapping the <span class="code">Column</span> you just created with a <span
                    class="code">Row</span> widget:
            </p>

            <div class="snippet">
                Row(
                  children: [
                    Column( … ), // <- This should be the Column you made in the previous step
                  ],
                );
            </div>
            <p>
                Now you can add the <span class="code">Icon</span>:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Above your <span class="code">Column</span> in the R<span class="code">ow</span>'s list of children,
                    add a <span class="code">Padding</span> widget
                </li>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Set its <span class="code">padding</span> to <span class="code">const EdgeInsets.all(8)</span>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <li>
                    For the child of the <span class="code">Padding</span> widget, use an
                    <span class="code">Icon</span>.
                </li>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        You can use any icon resource you want, though <span class="code">Icons.account_circle</span>
                        works nicely
                    </li>
                    <li>Set the <span class="code">Icon</span>'s <span class="code">size</span> property to 50.</li>
                </ul>
            </ul>
            <iframe class="tall" src="embed-new.html?id=684e599476eef2ec4b4508e6b2186c03&fw=true"></iframe>

            <p>
                Your first <span class="code">Row</span> is now complete! There are two more to go, though, and you need
                a <span class="code">Column</span> to put them in.
                Wrap your <span class="code">Row</span> with a <span class="code">Column</span> widget so that it looks
                like this:
            </p>
            <div class="snippet">
                Column(
                  children: [
                    Row( … ), // <- This should be the Row with your Icon and Text widgets.
                  ],
                );
            </div>
            <p>
                Then, finish up your new <span class="code">Column</span> with these steps:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Set the <span class="code">Column</span>'s mainAxisSize to min</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Otherwise it'll expand to fill the screen!</li>
                </ul>
                <li>Set the <span class="code">Column</span>'s <span class="code">crossAxisAlignment</span> to stretch
                </li>
                <ul>
                    <li>This will make all of its children full-width</li>
                </ul>
                <li>Add more widgets below your <span class="code">Row</span> in the <span class="code">Column</span>'s
                    list of children:
                </li>
                <ul>
                    <li>A <span class="code">SizedBox</span> with a height of 8</li>
                    <li>An empty <span class="code">Row</span> (no children or other properties)</li>
                    <li>A <span class="code">SizedBox</span> with a height of 16</li>
                    <li>Another empty <span class="code">Row</span></li>
                </ul>
            </ul>
            <iframe class="tall" src="embed-new.html?id=19ead6db4f42ce112fc0a7d2e0922466&fw=true"></iframe>

            <p>
                There are just a few steps to go now. Next up is the second row. Add the following to its list of
                children:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>A <span class="code">Text</span> widget with a street address like '123 Main Street'</li>
                <li>A <span class="code">Text</span> widget with a phone number like '800-123-1234'</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                If you run the code at this point, you'll see that the two <span class="code">Text</span> widgets are
                placed right up against each other rather than at opposite ends of the
                <span class="code">Row</span>, which isn't right.
                You can fix this by setting the <span class="code">Row</span>'s
                <span class="code">mainAxisAlignment</span> property to <span class="code">spaceBetween</span>, which
                will put any extra space between the two <span class="code">Text</span> widgets.
            </p>
            <iframe class="tall" src="embed-new.html?id=e6e07bbe96255b762163cf3e40906944&fw=true"></iframe>

            <p>
                The last step is to get those icons in place at the bottom of the card:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Add four <span class="code">Icon</span> widgets to the last <span class="code">Row</span>'s list of
                    children. You can use whichever icon resources you
                    like, but these would be a good way to show that your imaginary developer focuses on accessibility,
                    fast development, and multi-platform apps:
                </li>
                <ul>
                    <li><span class="code">Icons.accessibility</span></li>
                    <li><span class="code">Icons.timer</span></li>
                    <li><span class="code">Icons.phone_android</span></li>
                    <li><span class="code">Icons.phone_iphone</span></li>
                </ul>
                <li>Set the <span class="code">Row</span>'s <span class="code">mainAxisAlignment</span> property to
                    <span class="code">MainAxisAlignment.spaceAround</span></li>
            </ul>
