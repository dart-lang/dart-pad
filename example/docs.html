<p><h5> Collections</h5>
<p>The dart:core library provides basic collections, such as <code>List</code>, <code>Map</code>, and <code>Set</code>.</p>
<p>A List is an ordered collection of objects, with a length. Lists are sometimes called arrays. Use a List when you need to access objects by index.</p>
<p>

<pre code executable>List superheroes = ['Batman', 'Superman', 'Harry Potter'];
print(superheroes);</pre>

A Set is an unordered collection of unique objects. You cannot get an item by index (position). Adding a duplicate item has no effect.
<p>

<pre code executable>Set villians = new Set();
villians.add('Joker');
villians.addAll(['Lex Luther', 'Voldemort']);
print(villians);
</pre>

A Map is an unordered collection of key-value pairs. Maps are sometimes called associative arrays because maps associate a key to some value for easy retrieval. Keys are unique. Use a Map when you need to access objects by a unique identifier.
<p>

<pre executable>Map sidekicks = { 'Batman': 'Robin',
                  'Superman': 'Lois Lane',
                  'Harry Potter': 'Ron and Hermione' };
</pre>

<p>In addition to these classes, dart:core contains <code>Iterable</code>, an interface that defines functionality common in collections of objects. Examples include the ability to run a function on each element in the collection, to apply a test to each element,  to retrieve an object, and to determine length.</p>
<p>Iterable is implemented by List and Set, and used by Map for its keys and values.</p>
<p>For other kinds of collections, check out the <code>dart:collection</code>(#dart-collection) library.</p>
<p><h5> Date and time</h5>
<p>Use <code>DateTime</code> to represent a point in time and <code>Duration</code> to represent a span of time.</p>
<p>You can create DateTime objects with constructors or by parsing a correctly formatted string.</p>
<p><pre code executable>DateTime now = new DateTime.now();
DateTime berlinWallFell = new DateTime(1989, 11, 9);
DateTime moonLanding = DateTime.parse("1969-07-20");
</pre>Create a Duration object specifying the individual time units.
<p><pre code executable>Duration timeRemaining = new Duration(hours:56, minutes:14);
</pre>In addition to DateTime and Duration, dart:core contains the <code>Stopwatch</code> class for measuring elapsed time.

<h5> Uri</h5>
<p>A <code>Uri</code> object represents a uniform resource identifier, which identifies a resource on the web.</p>
<p><pre code executable>Uri dartlang = Uri.parse('http://dartlang.org/');</pre>
