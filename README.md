## Background

DartPad began as an online playground for the Dart language built by the Dart
tools team in 2015. It compiles, analyzes, and displays the results of its
users' Dart code, and can be embedded in other websites as an iframe.

In Dec 2019, we launched a new version of DartPad (dartpad.dev) with a fresh new
look-and-feel and support for the popular Flutter UI toolkit. To learn more
about the new DartPad, please check this [blog
post](https://medium.com/dartlang/a-brand-new-dartpad-dev-with-flutter-support-16fe6027784).
